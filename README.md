# Machine-Learning


In this repository, you will find multiple datasets where I applied supervised, unsupervised learning and text mining techniques.
These datasets reflect some examples of real-world problems.
The analytics platform I used was KNIME.


The supervised learning techniques I used:
Classification;
Regression.


The unsupervised learning techniques I used:
Clustering.


The text mining techniques I used:
Association Rules.


I hope you enjoy my work. Cheers!
