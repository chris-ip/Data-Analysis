# Machine-Learning


In this repository, you will find multiple datasets where I applied supervised, unsupervised learning and text mining techniques.

These datasets reflect some examples of real-world problems.

The analytics platform I used was KNIME.

//The supervised learning techniques I used//

Classification: Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine

Regression: Linear regression, regression tree

//The unsupervised learning techniques I used//

Clustering: K-means, hierarchical

//The text mining techniques I used//

Association Rules: Apriori

I hope you enjoy my work. Cheers!
